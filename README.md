## 📖 Overview

**SpectraX** is a cutting-edge fitness application that uses **MediaPipe Pose Detection** and **Three.js** to provide real-time workout tracking and form analysis. It doesn't just track your body; it understands your movement, counts reps (like squats), detects mistakes, and provides immersive 3D visual feedback.

The project features a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and an Express/Socket.io backend for real-time data processing and cross-device synchronization.

## ✨ Features

- 🏋️ **Intelligent Rep Counting**: Automatically detects and counts exercises like squats, pushups, and more.
- 📐 **Form Analysis**: Real-time feedback on exercise posture and "rep scores" based on accuracy.
- 🎥 **3D Body Mapping**: Immersive 3D skeleton rendering with WebGL/Three.js.
- 🔍 **Auto-Exercise Detection**: Uses AI to detect which exercise you are performing without manual selection.
- 📊 **Workout Summary**: Detailed post-workout analytics including rep streaks, duration, and accuracy.
- 🔄 **Replay System**: Review your performance with our built-in replay feature.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Sync**: Low-latency communication between frontend and backend via WebSockets.
